# Hey there ðŸ‘‹!
### Iâ€™m Raghad, a passionate and curious network security student with an eJPT certification, currently diving into the tech world at the Apple Academy. Iâ€™m all about building impactful solutions, from developing security-focused apps to creating engaging user experiences. With a knack for both programming and design, I strive to make interfaces that are not only functional but visually captivating.

### Iâ€™m always keen on expanding my skills, whether it's in app development or UI/UX design. When Iâ€™m not immersed in code, you might find me brainstorming ways to make digital security more accessible or exploring creative tech ideas.
